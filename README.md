The simulate and recover exercise showed the effectiveness and consistency of the EZ model as a replacement for the much more complicated drift diffusion model. By using variables simulated through the model to estimate our original values to make sure the EZ model is consistent with itself.

The first step we took in verifying the EZ diffusion model was simulation: predicting R_obs (accuracy rate), M_obs (mean response time), and V_obs (variance response time) from "realistic" model parameters in a (boundary separation), v (drift rate), and t (non-decision time). By plugging in our model parameters into the three forward EZ equations, we simulate using the model to gather behavioral data.

Our next step was to verify the accuracy of the EZ diffusion model by trying to derive estimated equivalents to our model parameters, thus the recovery section of the assignment. We first use sampling distributions through equations 7-9 to determine R_obs, M_obs, and V_obs, then plug those values back into our reverse EZ equations to find our estimated parameters. The use of sampling distributions helps test EZ while accounting for natural randomness present in human behavior. This is why we use three separate distributions for our three variables.

Finally, we can evaluate how accurate the model is to itself by calculating the biases and squared biases. To accurately determine the biases, we gather a sufficiently large population of data, 3000 trials with n values of 10, 40, and 4000, and then compare the averages across each 1000 trials. We find that our calculated biases are extremely close to zero, signifying that the equations we simulated model parameters from could consistently satisfy the condition that you could determine the prior variables from the simulated ones, supporting the efficacy of the EZ model. Additionally, we can verify that increasing n decreases our b^2, further supporting the EZ model.

Because we are only testing the accuracy of the EZ diffusion model, we cannot conclude anything regarding the validity of the model since we are only testing the model against itself to determine its consistency. Despite how low of a bar this may seem to be, making sure that a model is consistent is the first step in doing reproducible and scientifically sound work.

This assignment has taught me a lot in terms of how small things that seem obvious may be essential to the bigger picture, and that it is imperative to address each and every aspect of the workflow, especially when it comes to making sure your work is consistent and reproducible across multiple people and experimental conditions. There is still a lot to learn about diffusion models and how the EZ model even approximates something as complicated as a DDM, but being able to get close to the end result with 9 much simpler equations makes it much easier to implement.
